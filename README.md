# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My intention is to design an artificial intelligence system aimed at assisting individuals with mental health disorders that may be exacerbated by new technologies, such as gambling addiction, in collaboration with a professional.

## Background

This project aims to assist individuals who are struggling with such addictions and seeks to serve as a complementary tool for psychologists, providing them with additional information about their patients. It will enhance the recovery process by delivering reports to the responsible professional, thereby extending the support provided by the professional beyond the typical one-hour session per week.

## How is it used?

What I propose is software that can be installed on the patient's devices to analyze their behavior without interfering with it. In this manner, the artificial intelligence I intend to design will be responsible for analyzing user trends and generating a report on the patient's progress. In this way, the psychologist will be able to quickly assess how their patient has behaved, without having to wait for the patient to report it. This approach helps avoid potential dishonesty from the individual struggling with addiction and allows the session to be fully dedicated to addressing the problem rather than merely inquiring about the patient's experiences over the past week.

## Data sources and AI methods

This is a large-scale project that will need to start gradually. Initially, the AI will monitor the content that the user consumes on social media, particularly if it is related to gambling or similar activities. To achieve this, we require databases containing tweets that promote gambling, which can be used to train our AI. Additionally, we will need access to the transcripts of all videos viewed on other social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, so that by analyzing this text, the AI can determine whether it is harmful to the user.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge of this project is its intrusive nature; it requires TOTAL access to the patient's virtual life, which may border on legality even with the patient's consent, as they will likely be eager to contribute to improving their life. On the other hand, it has its limitations; after all, you cannot observe a person 24 hours a day. Therefore, any activities conducted on devices not registered with the software or any actions taken without using electronic devices will remain beyond our reach.

## What next?

From this point onward, this idea can only improve, expanding to address more issues that affect people's mental health, such as depression or video game addiction and similar problems. Within the realm of gambling addiction, it can also extend beyond social media to include applications and internet searches. Therefore, while this is a massive project, the possibilities are endless, as is the number of individuals and families that can be helped.
